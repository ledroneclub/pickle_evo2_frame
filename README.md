NOTE : this is an early prototype, for those willing to test.

Here's the new version of the Pickle Evo frame. The so called Evo2. The first version was quite bad so I remade Ã  MK2 focused on the new nano HD cameras that are coming out right now.

It would probably also fit a 19x19 but that was not the goal :)

* 3 inch props (115mm wheelbase).
* Squish layout (props out of camera view).
* Dual-plate design with unibody bottom plate.
* whoop, 16x16 and 20x20 stacks mount pattern.
* 9mm-12mm 4 hole motor mounts.
* TPU printed camera mount (14x14/HD format).
* Cutout for the USB port of aio boards (no need to flip the board & remap the motors)

You can get the frame cut at https://www.cncmadness.com, I recommend to go with a 3mm bottom plate and 1.5mm top plate.

You'll need some extra parts :
- 20mm M2 aluminium standoffs (4 pieces) + M2 screws.

You also need to get the camera holder printed (TPU should be the best option).
