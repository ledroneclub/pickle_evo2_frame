# Pickle Evo2 MK2 Nano

Pickle Evo2 ~~MK2~~ MK3 Nano is a micro quadcopter frame fitting 3 inch propeller and focused ~~on nano HD cameras~~ modularity. The base is a deadcat structure that can be flown as is (a 3 inch deadcat PicklePick) but it can host different adapter plates.
The first one coming along the frame is intended to bear an HD nano camera.

NOTE : this is an early prototype, for those willing to test mainly, first version was removed as quite inconvenient to build.

The Evo2 frame would probably also fit a 19x19 but that was not the goal of this design :)


~~#### EVO2 MK2 version~~ -- obsolete
~~* 3 inch props (115mm wheelbase).~~
~~* Squish layout (props out of camera view).~~
~~* Dual-plate design with unibody bottom plate.~~
~~* whoop, 16x16 and 20x20 stacks mount pattern.~~
~~* 9mm-12mm 4 hole motor mounts.~~
~~* TPU printed camera mount (14x14/HD format).~~
~~* Cutout for the USB port of aio boards (no need to flip the board & remap the motors)~~

## How to get this frame ?

You have to make it cut at a CNC Cutting service, here's some recommended ones.

* https://www.cncmadness.com (US/CA)
* https://www.ahltec.de (EU)

Get the files in the ```dxf_for_cnc_cutting``` folder (dxf files) and send them to the services mentionned above. I recommend to go with a 3mm bottom plate and 1.5mm top plate.


You'll need some extra mounting parts for the frame :
- 20mm M2 aluminium standoffs (4 pieces) + M2 screws.

You also need to get the camera holder printed (TPU should be the best option).
